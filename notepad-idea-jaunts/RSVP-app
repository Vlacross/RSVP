***************************************************

Wedding/Event RSVP & Update app
    -there would be a single superuser/admin account
    -there would be a level of accounts with read and write permissions for
        posting topics and update, as well as commenting on them.
    -there would be a level of majority accounts with read only permissions 
        for postings, but write permissions for commenting(to ask questions 
         or give feedback)

    Potentially implement 'Magic Links' as a Token distrobution feature

    Preset schema layout for Blogs and Comments, limited involvement with customization issues

        ?keep comments in own collection and reference with each blog?
        ?file size of posts if comments lived in post?    






(Maintain exclusiveness)would like to send (maybe single use/ expirable) 
       invitations to register-- if rsvp declined, dissolve authentication for id?(too complex for)
 







Would just be a multi tiered Auth implementation of Blog App
